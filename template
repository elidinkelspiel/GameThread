#NOTES & THOUGHTS

---

##Official game notes: <Don't know how I'm going to get these>

* It's LeBron vs. Dubs. I'm sure you've all read countless shit this week. For game 1, just sit back, and enjoy.


##Dinks' Thoughts:

* Who is going to guard LeBron? I would like to see Draymond and/or Iggy on the King, but Harrison will inevitably need to cover him.

* David Lee might get big minutes. TT/Mozgov are great rebounders, but fairly inept on offense. Dlee can rebound with the best of them, and his lack of defensive skills should be minimized covering Cleveland's bigs.

* They have 0 big men coming off the bench. Look for Draymond to get rest early so he can run the 5 later in the game. The small lineup will destroy a tired Tristan Thompson if he continues playing 42 minutes a game.
